Hi there! My name is Ram√≥n Iglesias. I am a civil engineer by title, but my experience spans areas traditionally aligned with software engineering and machine learning.

Currently, I am a Research Scientist at [Lyft's](https://www.lyft.com/) Driver Positioning Team where we develop real-time algorithms and incentives to optimize the supply of available drivers.

I completed my PhD at Stanford University under the supervision of [Marco Pavone](http://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/), director of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory ](http://asl.stanford.edu/). My research consisted of developing algorithms to control large fleets of self-driving vehicles. 

More broadly, my research and professional interests lie at the interplay between software systems and real-world infrastructure.
