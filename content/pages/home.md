Hi there! My name is Ram√≥n Iglesias. I am a civil engineer by title, but my experience spans areas traditionally aligned with software engineering and machine learning.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at Stanford University under the supervision of [Marco Pavone](http://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/), director of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory ](http://asl.stanford.edu/). My research consists of developing algorithms to control large fleets of self-driving vehicles. 

More broadly, my research and professional interests lie at the interplay between software systems and real-world infrastructure.

If you would like to chat, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:rdit@stanford.edu).
