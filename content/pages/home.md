Hi there! My name is Ram√≥n Iglesias. I have worn many hats, but my experience roughly spans software engineering, machine learning, and optimization.

I am the founder of [Clementine](https://clementine.games/), where we are building open source, AI technology for games. You can check out the [founding announcement]({filename}/clementine_announcement.md) and [Zaranova]({filename}/zaranova.md), my earlier proof-of-concept, to get a sense of what we want to enable.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) where I worked on real-time supply incentives and on using phone sensors to predict risk. Before that, I completed my PhD at Stanford University under the supervision of [Marco Pavone](http://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/), director of the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory ](http://asl.stanford.edu/). My research consisted of developing algorithms to control large fleets of self-driving vehicles. 

More broadly, my research and professional interests lie at the interplay between software systems and real-world infrastructure.

If you would like to chat, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:ramon.d.iglesias@gmail.com).
