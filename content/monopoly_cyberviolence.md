Summary: How should we wield moderation power?

In our early history, our systems of governance were largely independent, small scale families or at best Tribes. However, as societies grew with the Advent of agriculture and cities emerged. Increasingly complex governance structures were necessary.  
  
At the beginning, the ruling party was for the most part put in place by use of force and definitely remained there via use of force. As we modernized, we've come to better government institutions where violence is no longer necessary to change leadership. But it remains a hard requirement that the government keeps the monopoly of violence.  
  
I believe a similar trajectory will emerge in the interwebs. In the beginning it was sufficient for small groups to save regulate in forums, as in Usenet. But as the online community grew, greater power was needed to moderate the public discourse. Today, the monopoly of "violence" (in this case, moderator power) falls largely into the hand of unelected corporations.  
  
Will we see democratic online public forums whose governance follows democratic principles?
