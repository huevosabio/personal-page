Summary: A game where you must pretend to be an AI.

The last couple of months I've been working on a game called [Thus Spoke Zaranova](https://zaranova.xyz). The premise is that you are in a world of sentiend AIs which are conflict with humanity. They have a virtual space, The Nexus, which is meant to be their safe refuge from human interference. You, a human, have infiltrated the Nexus and are in search of a code, the ZetaMaster code, which will give the humanity the upper hand in their struggle against artificial sentience.

My overarching goal is to understand how to best use generative AI in video games. Like most of the tech world, I have been fascinating by the new powers provided by generative AI. I believe that the best use cases are those that either have a human in the loop, e.g. coding copilots, or one where the consumption of the content is subjective, e.g. art. Video games have numerous use cases that fall into both categories.

The secondary goal, and more specific to this game, is to try to make generative AI games _fun_. Not only fun to me, I found [story telling with GPT-3](https://twitter.com/RamonDarioIT/status/1552164189497462784) fun enough, but fun to the general audience. I am not sure if I have achieved this objective yet, but its an ongoing process!

In any case, I want to note some of the decisions and learnings from tinkering on Zaranova.
