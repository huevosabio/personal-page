Summary: Design states so that they can host multiple nations.

The US greatest asset is that it allows for the organic emergence and preservation of a myriad of cultures. This was not the original intent, the intent was to frame a government that was hamstrung and was unable to restrict the liberties of the governed.  
  
But the result has been extraordinary.  
  
The history of the 19th and 20th century is the history of the emergence of the Nation State followed by the, in theory, anational currents of international communism and American laissez-faire democracy. Communism proved to be inefficient and horrible to live in, but American democracy is still going strong, as is the idea of the nation state.  
  
Europe has toned down its reliance on nationalism, after all it is what got it destroyed. But it has not abandoned it. The European Union is more a confederation of nations than an anational institution. Their citizen laws are by blood rather than by place of birth. And their laws in general enforce a liberal European style of living.  
  
Elsewhere nationalism is strong. Russia went back to it immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. China's communism is closer to Chinese Fascism than Lenin's international communism. Israel is openly a Jewish state.  
  
The problem with nationalism is a problem of finite land. If we had infinite land, then any cultural or ethnic group could venture off and create their own nation state. But we have finite land, and every nation state is taking away land resources from other potential nation states. Every refuge we build for the Jewish, Kurdish, Armenian or Palestinian people is Land we take away from the rest.  
  
In a world of 7 billion people, this is not scalable.  
  
What is scalable is building societies that not only tolerate but encourage subsocieties with their own institutions. Nations of nations where the needs and desires of peoples are not placed in sum zero games.  
  
The United States is as of now the only country that seems to resemble this notion as of now, and it does not seem to me that other states are trying.  
  
It's also true that I don't see the United States doubling down on this valuable asset. Instead, the United States is paralyzed in time with the calendar still showing 2016. It is too busy fighting itself to lead anything.  
  
I wonder then how would a society based on the principles of not only liberty but also a platform nation, one that wants a thousand cultures to bloom, would look like.  
  
I think we could envision a multidimensional federal state. Federations partition society not only across geography but also across beliefs, religions, and more broadly culture.  
  
The geographic entities can be bestowed with the tasks that are necessary for the nation platform to exist, but nothing more. No need for the geographic governments to rule what can you or what can you not buy. In fact, any facet of life that is not linked to geography or externalities that propagate through geography should be delegated to cultural governments.
