Summary: I tore my ACL, had surgery. In the meantime, I learned some stuff.


On October 8, 2016, I tore my Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) playing soccer. When people ask, I try tell some increasingly convoluted lie about how I was about to score when a bunch of overly aggressive defenders went for my knee. Truth is, I was trying to gain possession of a divided ball, and, suddenly, I felt a crack and a lot of pain.

The ACL is a ligament that goes from the tibia to the femur [correction needed] with the purpose of keeping the knee in place. It is crucial for some movements, specially those that require sharp change of direction. Not coincidentally, it is also in these movements that people tend to tear it. Basketball, skiing, and, surprise!, soccer are common sports in which people tear their ACLs. 

Most of the time, physicians find out right away whether the injury was indeed an ACL tear. The injured recounts a particular "pop" (which makes my crack a pop). The physician then uses the Lachmann test, where he or she applies lateral pressure on your lower leg while holding your upper one and if the knee does not offer resistance the test is positive. And that is about it, you are diagnosed with an ACL tear. 

My case, however, was more elongated. At first I thought I had some minor injury, even if I could not put any weight on the leg. So I went ahead and watched some political news and had fried chicken with my roommate. After the pain relentlessly persisted my icing, I proceeded to an "urgent care" facility in San Francisco. They took some radiographies, said nothing looks bad here, asked me if I could walk (no!), and sold me a pair of crutches. Those crutches are the only thing of value from that visit (I am still using them as of this writing). 

The pain remained for the next days with the addition of some non-trivial swelling. With the swelling, came a reduction to my range of motion, and a subtle hint that perhaps a more severe injury than what I had gauged. Thus, I proceeded to my second medical visit, now a physician appointment at the university. He was the first to try the Lachmann test, however, he was unsure of the result. He advised me to keep on with my life, and if the swelling did not recede, to come back.

The swelling persisted, and back I went. 

The third medical visit was with the same physician, which now told me what had worried him, that his Lachmann test seemed inconclusive, and that I should make an appointment with another physician, Doug, who is more savvy in the arts of sports medicine. 

Doug, the host of my fourth medical visit, thought the Lachmann test was indeed inconclusive, so he helped me schedule an appointment to get an MRI. Naturally, these machines are expensive so the places that do have them experience quite some demand. It took several weeks for me to be able to take my MRI, but, when I did, it finally brought certainty to the whole situation.

"You have an ACL rupture, and a minor meniscus tear", greeted me Doug as I entered to my fifth medical appointment. This was the worst case scenario, but somehow I was quite happy that, after almost six weeks of walking with crutches, I finally knew what was wrong. We swiftly arranged an appointment with an Orthopedist, he gave me some instructions of dos and don'ts, and we parted ways. At this point, I was able to walk albeit slowly in one crutch.

A week later, in the office of Tim the Orthopedist, I was waiting in one of the private rooms. When he finally entered, he was flanked by a pair residents, avid to learn. He went over the MRI, and performed a Lachmann test only to confirm the diagnosis. He assured me everything would be fine, but that surgery would be inevitable. The ACL does not grow back, so a replacement was necessary.

My choices of graft (replacement tissue) were the following: remove a piece of the patella ligament from my own injured knee, remove some of the hamstring, or use the Achilles tendon of a cadaver. The idea of harming one part of my body to improve another one seem barbaric and undesirable, so I was inclined for taking that Achilles tendon. For some reason, the situation oddly resembled fixing a car by finding parts in a junkyard. Anyhow, I could choose a week before the surgery, and so I postponed my decision. More immediate was to set a surgery date.

As it turns out, after the surgery you are in a rather poor state, with at least a week of rest, and at least six weeks of no air travel.  This was a a big no for me, Christmas was around the corner and I had traveling plans with the family. Therefore, I chose the earliest Friday possible after New Years eve, which happened to be January 27, 2017 (slightly 3 months after the injury!). Why Friday? Apparently, it is
