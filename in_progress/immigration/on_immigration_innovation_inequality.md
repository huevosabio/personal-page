Summary: A conjecture on the root causes of rising inequality in the United States and how innovation and immigration can decrease or increase it.


---
Idea: start with stating the facts of inequality, and then go over the more popular explanations to why inequality has grown so much in the last 40 years in the US (and potentially accross the developed world). 

Categorize each potential contributor into either innovation, immigration or ? (where ? will be eventually defined, for example, it seems like we're missing some notion of welfare policy that can be a key component).

Causes that do not fall into immigration and innovation will not be explored after the inequality chapter, but hopefully I will get to deal with them in detail.
